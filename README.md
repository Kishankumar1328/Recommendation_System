# Course Recommendation System

Welcome to the Course Recommendation System! This project is a simple recommendation system for educational courses based on user interests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas streamlit
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/course-recommendation-system.git
cd course-recommendation-system
```

2. Run the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to use the Course Recommendation System.

## How it Works

The recommendation system is based on a dataset containing different engineering courses and their associated interests. Users can input their interests, and the system will recommend a course based on the most popular interest associated with that course.
